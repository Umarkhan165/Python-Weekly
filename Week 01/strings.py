# How does it work? :
# It stores the value of the each charcter or alphabet uniquely liek :"Umar" = ['U','m','a','r'] = [0,1,2,3,]
# What: Extracting part of a string.
# How: string[start:end] ‚Üí end is excluded.
# Why: To get substrings.
# When: Parsing emails, URLs, file names.

# String Formation :
#  It is also used for string formation 
# What: Inserting values into strings.
# How: f-strings, .format().
# Why: For clean, readable output.
# When: Displaying messages, reports.

# Immutability
# What: Strings can‚Äôt be changed directly.

# Why: Safety ‚Äî prevents accidental changes.
# When: Important in multi-threading and security
